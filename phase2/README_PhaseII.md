# COLINK Phase II – XRPL Integration (Repo Notes)

This branch scaffolds:
- COPX mock-issuer & trustline setup (XRPL testnet)
- Basic liquidity seeding (offers) for COL/COPX and COL/XRP
- Simple swap tests / quote checks (orderbook peek)
- Compliance monitor stub (logs-only)
- PowerShell manager to run tasks

**IMPORTANT**: Use XRPL TESTNET KEYS ONLY. Fill `.env.testnet` before non-dry runs.
